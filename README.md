Introducing My New SMM Panel Project
I’m excited to announce the completion of my latest project—a fully customizable Social Media Marketing (SMM) Panel designed to empower clients to manage a wide range of social media services with ease.

Project Overview
The SMM Panel is a robust platform that offers:

Service Management: Clients can purchase services such as likes, followers, subscribers, and views across popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
Dynamic Admin Controls: A dedicated admin panel that allows for dynamic rate modifications, API integrations for new services, user account management (including blocking, admin role assignment, and fund addition), and complete customization of website elements (domain name, social media links, logo, favicon).
Automated Payment Verification: The system utilizes an SMS-forwarding app and email parsing tools. When a payment is made to the admin's mobile wallet (e.g., JazzCash, EasyPaisa), an SMS notification is automatically forwarded to the admin’s Gmail account. A backend function then scans the inbox for payment details (transaction ID and amount) and automatically adds funds if the details match, or flags the payment for manual verification.
Secure Deployment: The application is deployed on a Windows VPS server with Nginx, Hostinger, and Win Acme for SSL certificates, ensuring both secure and efficient performance.
Responsive Frontend: Built with React.js, the frontend utilizes libraries like React Toastify and React Router. The system’s security is bolstered by robust authentication methods including JWT, Passport, and Bcrypt.
Client & Business Impact
This project has provided clients with a comprehensive platform to manage their social media marketing business, including the option to resell the SMM panel as a white-label solution. Key benefits include:

Real-time Service Updates: Enhances efficiency and user satisfaction with instant service modifications.
Automated Payment Processing: Reduces manual effort and minimizes errors by streamlining the payment verification and fund allocation process.
